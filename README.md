 Autism Disorder Detection Project:-
 
 Project Overview:- 
 This project focuses on detecting signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning models. 
 The goal is to assist early diagnosis by analyzing behavioral data and identifying patterns related to ASD.
 
 Objective:-
 To create an accurate, efficient model that can help predict autism based on questionnaire data and/or behavioral features.
 To raise awareness about how AI can support early detection efforts.

Techniques and Tools Used:-
Languages: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM).

How It Works:-
1:- Collected and cleaned a publicly available autism dataset.
2:- Performed data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
3:- Trained multiple machine learning models.
4:- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5:- Selected the best-performing model for final prediction.

Results:- 
1:- Achieved an accuracy of 92% with the Random Forest model.
2:- Important features included social interaction scores and communication patterns.
