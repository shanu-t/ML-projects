1:- **Autism Disorder Detection Project**
 
 **Project Overview**
 This project focuses on detecting signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning models. 
 The goal is to assist early diagnosis by analyzing behavioral data and identifying patterns related to ASD.
 
 **Objective**:-
 To create an accurate, efficient model that can help predict autism based on questionnaire data and/or behavioral features.
 To raise awareness about how AI can support early detection efforts.

**Techniques and Tools Used**:-
Languages: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM).

**How It Works**:-
1:- Collected and cleaned a publicly available autism dataset.
2:- Performed data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
3:- Trained multiple machine learning models.
4:- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5:- Selected the best-performing model for final prediction.

**Results**:- 
1:- Achieved an accuracy of 92% with the Random Forest model.
2:- Important features included social interaction scores and communication patterns.




2 :- **Credit Card Fraud Detection Project**:-

**Project Overview**:-
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to build a model that can differentiate between genuine and fraudulent transactions based on historical data.

**Objective**:-
Develop a reliable system to detect fraud accurately.
Handle class imbalance effectively (since fraudulent transactions are rare compared to genuine ones).
Analyze key patterns and features leading to fraud detection.

**Tools and Technologies**:-
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Techniques: Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

**Project Workflow**:-
1:- Data Collection: Used a publicly available dataset (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset).
2:- Data Exploration: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
3:- Preprocessing: Handled missing values, scaled features, and balanced the dataset using SMOTE.
4:- Model Training: Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to detect fraud.
5:- Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

**Result**:-
Achieved an ROC-AUC score of 98%.
High recall score ensured minimal false negatives (critical for fraud detection).
